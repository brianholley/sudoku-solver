# sudoku-solver

These basic sudoku solvers are a testing a learning ground for me to pick up new languages or try different approaches to languages that I already know

## Current languages

* C# - Trying out a little bit more functional approach to a basic solver
* F# - Learning (in progress)
* Clojure - Learning (in progress)

## Pending languages

* Python
* Scala
* C++14
* Javascript/Node
